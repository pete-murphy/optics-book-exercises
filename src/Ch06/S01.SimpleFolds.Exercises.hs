-- | 1 Whatâ€™s the result of each expression? Make sure to guess before trying it
-- out in the repl!
--
-- My guesses
-- a. (first guess)
--    ["Sirens", "Kraken", "Ogopogo"]
-- a. (after looking at other questions)
--    [(3, "Sirens"), (882, "Kraken"), (92, "Ogopogo")]
--    (Same as original)
--
-- b. ["Sirens", "Kraken", "Ogopogo"]
--
-- c. "SirensKrakenOgopogo"

-- Wait... goddammit, amending guesses
-- a. >>> beastSizes ^.. folded
-- b. >>> beastSizes ^.. folded . folded
-- c. >>> beastSizes ^.. folded . folded . folded
-- a, b, & c are all the same, since they're already lists
--    [(3, "Sirens"), (882, "Kraken"), (92, "Ogopogo")]
--
-- >>> beastSizes ^.. folded . _2
-- d. ["Sirens", "Kraken", "Ogopogo"]
--
-- >>> toListOf (folded . folded) [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
-- Guess: [1..6]
--
-- >>> toListOf
--      (folded . folded)
--      (M.fromList [("Jack", "Captain"), ("Will", "First Mate")])
-- Guess: "CaptainFirst Mate"

-- >>> ("Hello", "It's me") ^.. both . folded
-- Guess: "HelloIt's me"

-- >>> ("Why", "So", "Serious?") ^.. each
-- Guess: ["Why", "So", "Serious?"]

-- quotes :: [(T.Text, T.Text, T.Text)]
-- quotes = [("Why", "So", "Serious?"), ("This", "is", "SPARTA")]

--- >>> quotes ^.. each . each . each
--- "WhySoSerious?ThisisSPARTA"

-- Write out the `specialized` type for each of the requested combinators used
